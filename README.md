# Bench -- Laboratory Instrument Control

## Introduction

Bench is a lightweight package built on top of Pyvisa. It interfaces with USB- or LAN-connected VISA-compatible test instruments and allows the user to develop well documented and repeatable bench measurements while harnessing the full feature set of their bench instruments.

The intention of this module is to provide the ability to use Jupyter Notebooks and this package to develop an open-source, easy to use notebook-style workflow for electronics design and analysis. For laboratory automation, I recommend https://github.com/usnistgov/labbench which offers extended capability for more advanced usage.
